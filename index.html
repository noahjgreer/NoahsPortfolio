            in your pajamas, watch some TV and work at the same time. That’s still pretty cool," says Sara Sutton Fell, the founder and CEO of Flexjobs.com. Well, there’s more to it. It all depends on the job and how flexible you are. To find out what
            exactly constitutes flexibility, we asked Sutton Fell some questions. What does it mean to work from home in a job? "If your company has a policy in place to let you work from home — or even if you can access work from home if you have an
            urgent issue that's not tied to your office location — that should be your primary option for work," says Sutton Fell. If you're out of work and looking for a job, it's also a good option to consider. You'll save a lot of money commuting and
            you don't have to deal with rude people on the subway or at your desk.</p>
